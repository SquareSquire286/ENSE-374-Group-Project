1. Early User Stories on Kanban board
1. Manifesto - team responsibilities/protocol/vision/tenats

## Determining Our 'Why'?
1. We don't want an *Uber for Bikes* - can't create a problem that isn't there
1. What we make should ultimately be useful
	1. Something half complete isn't complete at all
	1. MVPs *should* actually be viable - finished product should be even better
	
## Fitting Problems
1. Food apps (the middle man issue, payment methods) - we don't have access to the data and the problem is mostly solved
1. Traffic/Construction visualization - already done
1. Exercise specific diet
1. University event notification system
1. App that finds cool little hangout spots recommened by others
