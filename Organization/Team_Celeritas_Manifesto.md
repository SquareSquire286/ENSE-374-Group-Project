Team Celeritas Manifesto (IN PROGRESS)
Dhruv Modi, Wil J. Norton, Jacob Sauer

Primary Objective

Team Celeritas (TC) is a temporary organization formed for the purpose of an ENSE 374 (Software Engineering Management) design and development project. Throughout this project, TC will strive to create a complete, beneficial, and intriguing software application by December 2019, while attempting to embody and embrace the ideals of an efficient software engineering process.

Secondary Objectives

	•	Ensuring that the operation of our application is predicated on user input 
	•	Maintaining a development cycle involving frequent internal and outsider feedback 
	•	Finding and improving our own individual flaws as students, innovators, and designers 

Core Tenets

	•	100% accountability (the organization lives and dies by work ethic) 
	•	Do not create Uber for Bikes (creating a problem simply to say that you have solved a problem is an extremely flawed foundation; problems should be “real and raw” in that they represent genuine day-to-day struggles for which no end-all, be-all solution exists) 
	•	

Strategy

	•	Operating within a week-long sprint cycle; user stories are defined at the beginning of the sprint, and constant acceleration is encouraged
