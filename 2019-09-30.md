**Agenda**

1. Discuss user needs
2. Brainstorm user stories for Kanban board
3. Dig for requirements

**Discussion Points**

1. Who are our users? - primarily university personnel (new students, international students, faculty, special guests, visitors)
2. Some user groups may have different needs (simple navigation for visitors and new students, finding the optimal path might be the primary purpose for returning students)
3. Could be used sporadically for one-time trips to unfamiliar rooms (e.g. co-op interviews, luncheons)
4. Thus, we have two use cases - establishing a daily navigation routine (university personnel only), and sporadic use for one-time engagements in a specific location (essentially all users)
5. Now that we have a potential customer (Distance Learning Centre), it will be important to correspond with them and learn about any potential use cases that we've missed, and consider why THEY want to use it
6. What is the domain of this project? University - routes and paths exist intrinsically, attributes and methods would be structured around locations within the university

**User Stories**

1. In order to get to a certain location, people need to know a route to get there from their current location.
2. In order to get to a certain location ON TIME, people need to know a time-efficient route from their current location.
3. As a commuting student, I want to find a quick route from my parking spot to my first class in case I'm running late one day.
4. As a student, I don't want to take an outside route during the winter even if it's the most efficient.
5. As a guest on campus, I don't want to get lost on my way to an engagement and risk my performance suffering as a result of the stress.
6. As a guest on campus, I want to always have a map in front of me because I won't be familiar enough to read a map on the wall.
7. As a guest on campus, I want to know the simplest possible route to a certain location (not necessarily the most efficient).
8. As a university patron, I want to ensure that a staircase or elevator will take me to a specific floor.
9. As a university patron, I want to know all alternate routes in the event of my typical route being closed due to construction or other circumstances beyond my control.
