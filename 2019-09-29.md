**Agenda**

1. Order of operations for completing the deliverables
  a) Manifesto
  b) Requirements Document
  c) Kanban & user stories
  d) Presentation
2. Brainstorming a few more decent ideas, and actually choosing one (numerical evaluation matrix)
3. Work on the Team Celeritas Manifesto (likely done concurrently with requirements document)

**Opening Discussion**

1. Brainstormed numerous ideas for ~1 hour, determined a shortlist of four potentially viable ideas which meet each of the Four Spheres of Effective Startup Applications as discussed above
  i. An application that helps U of R students find hangout spots and nooks / crannies to match their moods or desired tasks (e.g. doing the studying, having the lunch)
  ii. An application that determines the best possible route to a U of R classroom and serves as a dynamic map for new students or returning students with poor senses of direction
  iii. An application that allows for one device (smartphone, TV, laptop, etc) to serve as an audio source for another device
  iv. An application that familiarizes people with different dialects and accents for different languages
2. Numerical evaluation matrix determining that the university path-finder (idea #ii) is our ideal choice of the four (see Numerical Evaluation Matrix file in repository)
3. Briefly discussed functionality ideas, current plan is to make the path-finder the MVP and potentially have the nooks and crannies idea as a stretch goal
4. Updated the manifesto for Team Celeritas
5. Created file for requirements document, with intention to meet tomorrow after class and begin it
